The core developer teams comprises Stefan Webb, Feynman Liang, and Fritz Obermeyer [link Github profiles]. Please contact us if you are interested in becoming a core developer! A good way to begin is to contribute bug fixes, new features, and exciting tutorials [links to relevant parts on GH site].

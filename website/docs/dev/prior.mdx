:::info

If you know of a paper or library that ought to be listed in this bibliography but is not please let us know [in the forum](https://github.com/stefanwebb/flowtorch/discussions) or by [starting a pull request](https://github.com/stefanwebb/flowtorch/pulls). We aim for completeness within the scope of the field of normalizing flows.

I have produced the pages in this section by converting the BibTeX file by hand to Markdown - in the future, this process should be automated! I suggest storing the BibTeX entries in an XML format and converting this to `.bib` and `.mdx`. Also, we should write a `jdx` component to format the entries.

In a future release, include video recordings of lectures on normalizing flows.

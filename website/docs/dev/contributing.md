## Call for Contributions
We are looking for independent collaborators to:
* add new [bijections](/dev/bijector) (i.e., normalizing flow transforms) and [conditioning networks](/dev/params);
* [discover and fix bugs](https://github.com/stefanwebb/flowtorch/issues/new/choose); and,
* write tutorials on applications of Normalizing Flow methodology.

The [Core Developers](/dev/about) are able to help smooth [the process of making a contribution](/dev/overview).

:::info
Please contact us in [the forum](https://github.com/stefanwebb/flowtorch/discussions) if you are interested in becoming an independent contributor and tag your discussion with ":bulb: Ideas" - the process is outlined [here](/dev/overview).
